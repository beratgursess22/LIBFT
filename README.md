# LIBFT

Libft is one of the fundamental projects in the 42 Cursus and revolves around writing several essential functions from scratch in C. This project is an excellent opportunity to grasp the fundamentals of the C programming language while also understanding how standard library functions work. Additionally, it introduces more advanced concepts for beginners, such as linked lists.

What is Libft?
Libft is a project that involves creating a personal C library, containing functions that can be reused in future projects. Many of these functions are recreations of standard library functions (from stdlib.h, string.h, ctype.h, etc.), while others involve more complex data structures like linked lists.

Contents of the Libft Project
The functions in Libft can be categorized into the following sections:

1. Reimplementation of Standard Library Functions

This category involves rewriting many functions from the C standard library, such as strlen, memcpy, strdup, and atoi. This helps develop a deep understanding of memory management, pointers, and string manipulation.

2. Memory Management Functions

Functions like malloc and free are explored to understand dynamic memory allocation.
Functions such as memset, bzero, memcpy, and memmove handle various memory operations.

3. String Manipulation Functions

Functions like strlen, strcpy, strncpy, strdup, strlcpy, strlcat, strcmp, strncmp, strchr, strrchr, strstr, strnstr, strjoin, strtrim, substr, and split are implemented.
These functions enhance understanding of how strings are represented, how pointers work, and how to efficiently manage memory.

4. Character Classification Functions

Functions such as isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, isascii, isprint, toupper, and tolower are implemented for checking and modifying character values.
5. Linked List Implementation

A t_list struct is created to handle linked lists.
Functions like ft_lstnew, ft_lstadd_front, ft_lstadd_back, ft_lstsize, ft_lstlast, ft_lstdelone, ft_lstclear, ft_lstiter, and ft_lstmap perform operations like adding, deleting, sorting, and transforming linked lists.
